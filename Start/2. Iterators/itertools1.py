# Itertools: count, cycle, accumulate


import itertools

names = ["Joe", "Jane", "Jim"]

# cycle iterator can be used to cycle over a collection infinitely


# use count to create a simple counter


# accumulate creates an iterator that accumulates values
vals = [10,20,30,40,50,40,30]


# amortize a loan over a set number of payments for a 2000 loan at 4%
payments = [100, 125, 200, 105, 100, 120, 110, 130, 150, 100, 110, 120]
